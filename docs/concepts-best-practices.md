# Core Concepts & Best Practices

This document covers some fundamental WebAssembly concepts and best practices to keep in mind as you develop WASM applications.

## Core WebAssembly Concepts (Summary)

Understanding these core ideas is essential for working effectively with WebAssembly.

*   **Modules (`.wasm` file):**
    A WebAssembly module is a compiled unit of code, typically distributed as a `.wasm` file. It's a stateless, self-contained binary that includes functions, import/export declarations, memory layout, and table definitions. Think of it as the compiled "library" or "program."

*   **Memory:**
    Each WebAssembly instance has access to a sandboxed region of **linear memory**. This memory is a contiguous, resizable array of raw bytes, accessible from both WebAssembly code and (with limitations) from JavaScript. WASM code can read and write to this memory directly. Its sandboxed nature means a WASM module cannot directly access memory outside its designated area, enhancing security. Memory can be "grown" if more space is needed at runtime.

*   **Tables:**
    A WebAssembly table is a resizable, typed array of opaque references, most commonly used to store references to functions (function pointers). Tables are essential for implementing indirect function calls, which are crucial for features like function pointers in C/C++ or dynamic dispatch in high-level languages compiled to WASM. This allows WASM to call functions whose addresses aren't known at compile time.

*   **Instances:**
    An instance is a runnable, stateful WebAssembly module in memory. It's created by instantiating a module. Each instance has its own dedicated memory, table(s), and a set of imported and exported values (functions, globals, memory, tables). You can have multiple instances of the same module, each with its own state.

*   **Text Format (.wat):**
    While WebAssembly is a binary format (`.wasm`), it also has a human-readable **text format (`.wat`)**. This S-expression based format represents the structure and instructions of a WASM module. `.wat` is extremely useful for debugging, understanding the low-level details of compiled code, and sometimes for writing small WASM snippets by hand, though most WASM is generated by compilers.

*   **JavaScript API:**
    The WebAssembly JavaScript API is the bridge between JavaScript and WebAssembly in web environments. Key functionalities include:
    *   **Loading `.wasm` modules:** Fetching the binary code (e.g., using `fetch`).
    *   **Compiling:** `WebAssembly.compile()` or `WebAssembly.compileStreaming()` turns `.wasm` binary code into a `WebAssembly.Module`.
    *   **Instantiating:** `WebAssembly.instantiate()` or `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` creates an `WebAssembly.Instance` from a `Module`, also setting up imports (like memory or functions provided by JS) and making exports available to JS.
    *   **Calling Functions:** JavaScript can call exported WASM functions, and WASM functions can call imported JavaScript functions.
    *   **Accessing Memory:** JavaScript can read from and write to an instance's `WebAssembly.Memory` object (the `ArrayBuffer` representing the WASM memory), but this requires care.

## Best Practices

Adopting good practices will help you build more efficient, secure, and maintainable WebAssembly applications.

### Project Structure

A well-organized project is easier to navigate and maintain.
*   Consider separating your source code (e.g., Rust, C++), compiled WASM modules, JavaScript interop code, documentation, and tests into distinct directories.
*   The structure used in this repository (`/docs`, `/src` for potential shared libraries, `/examples` for standalone demos, `/tests`, `/build`, `/scripts`) provides a good model that can be adapted to various project sizes.

### Performance Considerations

*   **Minimize JS <-> WASM Calls:** Each call between JavaScript and WebAssembly has some overhead. For performance-critical sections, try to perform as much computation as possible within WASM before returning a result to JavaScript. Avoid chatty interactions across the boundary for tight loops.
*   **Data Transfer:** Copying large amounts of data between JavaScript and the WASM linear memory can be slow.
    *   Transfer only necessary data.
    *   For complex data, consider serializing/deserializing it efficiently.
    *   *Advanced:* For very high-performance needs, explore `WebAssembly.SharedArrayBuffer` (Shared Memory), but be aware of its complexity and security implications (requires specific HTTP headers like COOP/COEP).
*   **Module Size:** Smaller `.wasm` modules load and compile faster.
    *   Use compiler optimizations (e.g., `-O2`, `-Os`, `-Oz` in Emscripten; release profiles with LTO in Rust).
    *   Run tools like `wasm-opt` (from the Binaryen toolkit) to further optimize and shrink your `.wasm` files.
    *   Remove unused code (dead code elimination) via compiler flags.
*   **Streaming Compilation/Instantiation:**
    For web applications, always prefer `WebAssembly.compileStreaming()` and `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()`. These APIs start compiling/instantiating the WASM module as soon as the first bytes arrive over the network, significantly speeding up startup compared to waiting for the full download before processing.

### Security Considerations

*   **Sandboxed by Default:** WebAssembly's sandbox is a strong security feature, preventing direct access to arbitrary system resources.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Compiled Code:** The code you compile *to* WASM (especially from memory-unsafe languages like C/C++) can still have vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. These could potentially be exploited within the WASM sandbox. Use secure coding practices in your source language and employ linters/static analyzers.
*   **Validate Inputs:** Treat data coming from JavaScript or any external source that is passed into your WASM module as untrusted. Validate and sanitize inputs on the WASM side to prevent unexpected behavior or security issues.
*   **Careful with Imports:** Be mindful of the functions and capabilities you provide to your WASM module via imports. Grant only necessary permissions.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

*   **Core WASM (MVP):** The core WebAssembly Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is widely supported across all modern browsers.
*   **Post-MVP Features:** Newer features like SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), threads, reference types, or multi-value returns might have varying levels of support. Check compatibility tables (e.g., on [webassembly.org](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/) or MDN) if you plan to use these advanced features.
*   **Testing:** Always test your WASM applications on the major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) you intend to support.

### Debugging WASM Modules

Debugging WASM can be more challenging than pure JavaScript, but tools are improving.
*   **Browser Developer Tools:**
    *   Most browsers allow you to view the `.wat` (text format) of your WASM modules in the debugger's "Sources" or "Debugger" panel.
    *   If source maps are correctly generated and loaded, you might be able to step through your original source code (e.g., Rust, C++). This experience varies by language and toolchain.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Use `console.log()` in your JavaScript code to trace interactions with WASM.
    *   Import a logging function from JavaScript into your WASM module to log messages from within your WASM code.
*   **WASM Inspection Tools:**
    *   Tools like `wasm-objdump` (from WABT - WebAssembly Binary Toolkit) or `wasm2wat` can help you inspect the contents and structure of `.wasm` files.
*   **Language-Specific Debuggers:** Some ecosystems (like C/C++ with Emscripten or Rust) have specific debugging guides or integrations with tools like GDB or LLDB, though this is often more complex for browser-targeted WASM.

By keeping these concepts and best practices in mind, you can build more robust, performant, and secure WebAssembly applications.

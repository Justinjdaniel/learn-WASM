# Modern WebAssembly Learning Repository

Welcome! This repository is designed to be a top-tier, modern resource for learning WebAssembly (WASM) in 2025. Our goal is to provide clear explanations, practical examples, and up-to-date information to help you master WASM.

For detailed documentation, please see the [docs](./docs) directory.

This repository is organized into the following main directories:
*   `/docs`: Contains detailed documentation, guides, and conceptual explanations.
*   `/src`: Will house core library code or reusable modules (currently planned).
*   `/examples`: Provides practical, hands-on examples of WebAssembly in action.
*   `/tests`: Will include tests for any code developed in `/src` or `/examples`.
*   `/build`: Will be used for build artifacts and outputs.
*   `/scripts`: Contains utility scripts for building, testing, or managing the repository.
